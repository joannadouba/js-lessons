// Abstraction inside Constructor Functions
// Getters and Setters
// When we write constructor functions, we must be aware of the properties that are being displayed to the outside, since there are things we might not want to be exposed to the end user. So, we can define them as variables inside the constructor function instead to protect them. Example below:

function Circle1(radius) {
    this.radius = radius;

    //instead of:
    // this.defaultLocation = { x:0, y:0 };
    // this.computeOptimumLocation = function(factor) {
    //     console.log('optimum location', factor);
    // }
    let defaultLocation = { x:0, y:0 };
    // To access this variable (defaultLocation) from the outside of the object, we must do the following:
    Object.defineProperty(this, 'defaultLocation', 
        {
            get: function() {
                return defaultLocation;
            },
            set: function(value) {
                if(!value.x || !value.y)
                    throw new Error('Invalid location')
                defaultLocation = value;
            }
        }
    )

    let computeOptimumLocation = function(factor) { 
        console.log('optimum location', factor);
    }
    
    this.draw = function(){
        computeOptimumLocation(1);
        console.log('draw');
    }
}

const circle3 = new Circle1(10);
// circle3.computeOptimumLocation();
// circle3.draw();
console.log(circle3)
circle3.defaultLocation = {x: 1, y: 1};
console.log(circle3)

// Inheritance:
// Allows an object to take on methods and props from another object

// Classical Inheritance:
// If we have 2 classes Circle and Square, which have a common method (ex. computeOptimumLocation() ) which has the exact same code implementation inside of it. We don't want to repeat the code twice because if we have to change it, we have to change it in 2 places. Now let's imagine we have 100's or 1000's of these objects, maintaining the code becomes completely unmanageable.
// Instead of doing that, we can define a new class called Shape and include the computeOptimumLocation() method there, then have Circle and Square *inherit* the methods and properties of the Shape class.
// Shape Class (there are no classes in JS, but this is the explanation of Classical Inhertiance)
// Base / Super / Parent Class: Shape
// Derived / Sub / Child Class: Circle, Square
// Inheritance relationship: IS-A relationship (is a)
// -> Circle IS-A Shape

// In JS there are no classes, so it's Prototypical Inheritance
// Prototypical Inheritance:
// A prototype for an object is a *parent* object
// Every object in JS except for 1 object (to be discussed later) has a prototype, or parent and it *inherits* all the members found in the prototype.

let x = {};
// We will have a property in Dev Tools called "__proto__"
// Every object has a "constructor" property that was used to construct or create that object
// One method that is passed down by prototypical inheritance to the object "x" is the method .toString()

// We should NOT use the __proto__ in our code because it is a DEPRECATED PROPERTY
console.log(x.toString()); // returns [object Object]

let y = {};
// To get the Prototype of an object:
// Object.getPrototypeOf(object);
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(x));

if (Object.getPrototypeOf(x) === Object.getPrototypeOf(y)) {
    console.log(true);
} else {
    console.log(false);
}

// When we typed 'x.toString()', the JS engine looked through the 'x' object first, didn't find the method, so it looked through the methods available to the Object Prototype which the 'x' object inherits from.

// Multi-level Inheritance
// When we create an Array, we are actually creating an object, because an Array is really an object, there is no typeOf Array 
let myArray = [];
console.log(typeof myArray); // returns object

// So, myArray has a prototype of Array, which has a prototype of Object
